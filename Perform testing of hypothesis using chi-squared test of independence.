Prepare a contingency table as shown above. To calculate Girls Students with ‘O’ Grade

Go to Cell N6 and type =COUNTIF($J$2:$K$40,"O")

 

To calculate Girls Students with ‘A’ Grade

Go to Cell O6 and type =COUNTIF($J$2:$K$40,"A")

 

To calculate Girls Students with ‘B’ Grade

Go to Cell P6 and type =COUNTIF($J$2:$K$40,"B")

 

To calculate Girls Students with ‘C’ Grade

Go to Cell Q6 and type =COUNTIF($J$2:$K$40,"C")

 

To calculate Girls Students with ‘D’ Grade

Go to Cell R6 and type =COUNTIF($J$2:$K$40,"D")

 

To calculate Boys Students with ‘O’ Grade

Go to Cell N7 and type =COUNTIF($D$2:$E$62,"O")

 

To calculate Boys Students with ‘A’ Grade

Go to Cell O7 and type =COUNTIF($D$2:$E$62,"A")

 

To calculate Boys Students with ‘B’ Grade

Go to Cell P7 and type =COUNTIF($D$2:$E$62,"B") To calculate Boys Students with ‘C’ Grade

Go to Cell Q7 and type =COUNTIF($D$2:$E$62,"C")





To calculate Boys Students with ‘D’ Grade

Go to Cell R7 and type =COUNTIF($D$2:$E$62,"D")

To calculated the expected value Ei
Go to Cell N9 and type =N8/2 Go to Cell O9 and type =O8/2 Go to Cell P9 and type =P8/2 Go to Cell Q9 and type =Q8/2 Go to Cell R9 and type =R8/2

Go to Cell S6 and calculate total girl students = SUM(N6:R6) Go to Cell S7 and calculate total girl students = SUM(N7:R7)

 

Now Calculate
Go to cell T6  and type

=SUM((N6-$N$9)^2/$N$9,(O6-$O$9)^2/$O$9,(P6-$P$9)^2/$P$9,(Q6-Q$9)^2/$Q$9, (R6-$R$9)^2/$R$9)

Go to cell T7  and type

=SUM((N7-$N$9)^2/$N$9,(O7-$O$9)^2/$O$9,(P7-$P$9)^2/$P$9,(Q7-Q$9)^2/$Q$9, (R7-$R$9)^2/$R$9)

To get the table value go to cell T11 and type =CHIINV(0.05,4)


Go to cell O13 and type =IF(T8>=T11," H0 is Accepted", "H0 is Rejected")
